            and valued by the organization.</li>

        <p>I’m a board certified psychiatrist and Emotional Liberation Strategist who specializes in helping high-achievers learn to reprogram old patterns that no longer serve their growth or well-being so that they can live lives with more meaning, purpose and impact.
        <p>Whether helping a non-profit leader find her voice navigating as a Black leader in a predominantly white organization or a corporate leader focus on her emotional wellbeing in spite of work-related demands, I help my clients learn to honor themselves and prioritize wellness. My wellness strategies transform feelings of self-doubt and overwhelm to feeling capable, confident, and in control.</p>
        <p>The superstars who work with me have a renewed sense of clarity and purpose that allows them to live fearlessly and authentically, love all of who they are and create strategies for cultivating calm even in the midst of chaos.</p>
